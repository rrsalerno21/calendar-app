# Calendar App
A calendar app built with Javascript/jQuery, Moment.js, HTML, CSS.  Allows the user to save calendar events as text inputs for workday hours, and saves all inputs to local storage.  Deployed at [https://rrsalerno21.github.io/calendar-app/](https://rrsalerno21.github.io/calendar-app/)


## Technology Used
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, [Moment.js API](https://momentjs.com/)

## What I Learned
I learned that DOM traversal to grab data attributes makes for lengthy code when doing event delegation via jQuery.  I'm sure that I can go back into the HTML and place my data attributes in easier-to-access locations, but nevertheless, what I have is fully functional.
