# Calendar App
A calendar app built with Javascript/Jquery, Moment.js, HTML, CSS.  Allows the user to save calendar events as text inputs for workday hours, and saves all inputs to local storage.

## Technology Used
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/Jquery, Moment.js API

## What I Learned
I learned that DOM traversal to grab data attributes makes for lengthy code.  I'm sure that I can go back into the HTML and place my data attributes in easier-to-access locations.
